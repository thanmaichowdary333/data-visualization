The Iris dataset is one of the most famous datasets used in machine learning and statistics, particularly for classification tasks. It consists of 150 samples from three species of iris flowers: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica. 

Pie Plot: A circular chart divided into slices to illustrate numerical proportions. Each slice represents a category’s contribution to the whole, with the size of the slice corresponding to the percentage or proportion of that category relative to the total.

Scatter Plot: A type of plot that displays values for two variables for a set of data. Points are plotted on the horizontal and vertical axes and help visualize relationships between the variables.

Pair Plot: A grid of scatter plots showing relationships between pairs of features in a dataset. It provides an overview of the distribution and interactions between multiple variables.

Joint Plot: A type of plot that simultaneously displays a scatter plot of two variables along with their individual distributions (usually histograms or density plots) on the axes. It helps visualize the relationship between two variables as well as their marginal distributions.

KDE Plot (Kernel Density Estimate Plot): A KDE plot is a smooth, continuous curve that estimates the probability density function of a random variable. It is used to visualize the distribution of data, similar to a histogram, but it provides a smoother representation of the data’s distribution.
